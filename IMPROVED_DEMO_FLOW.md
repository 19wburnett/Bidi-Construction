This guide covers the enhanced demo system with the improved "Collecting Bids" flow.

## üéØ **New Demo Flow**

### What Happens Now:
1. **Post Job Request** ‚Üí Job starts with "Collecting Bids" status
2. **Loading Animation** ‚Üí Shows spinning indicator with "Collecting bids..." text

## üöÄ **Setup Instructions**

### 1. Run Database Migrations

Run both migrations in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- First migration (if not already run)
-- Copy contents of supabase-migration-add-admin-flag.sql

-- Second migration (new)
-- Copy contents of supabase-migration-add-collecting-bids-status.sql
```

### 2. Set Up Admin Account

```bash
# Using the setup script
node setup-admin.js your-email@example.com

# Or manually in Supabase SQL editor:
UPDATE users 
SET is_admin = TRUE, 
    role = 'admin',
    demo_mode = TRUE
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### 3. Enable Demo Mode

1. Log in with your admin account
2. Go to Admin ‚Üí Demo Settings
3. Toggle demo mode ON

## üé¨ **Demo Experience**

### For Your Audience:

1. **Create Job Request**:
   - Fill out job details normally
   - Submit the form
   - Redirected to dashboard

2. **Watch the Magic**:
   - Job card shows "Collecting bids..." with spinning animation
   - Demo bids appear one by one over time
   - Each bid has realistic company info, pricing, and timelines

3. **Interactive Control**:
   - Click "Stop Collecting" to end early
   - Or wait for automatic timeout (5 minutes)

### Demo Features:

- **Realistic Timing**: Bids appear over 0-30 seconds + staggered delays
- **Budget-Aware Pricing**: Bid amounts adjust to your selected budget range
- **Trade-Specific Content**: Different demo data for each trade category
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear status indicators and loading animations
- **User Control**: Stop collection anytime you want

## üîß **Technical Details**

### New Database Fields:
- `status`: 'active' | 'closed' | 'collecting_bids'
- `bid_collection_started_at`: When collection began
- `bid_collection_ends_at`: When collection should end

### New API Endpoints:
- `/api/generate-demo-bids`: Starts async bid generation
- `/api/check-bid-timeouts`: Automatically moves jobs to active status

### Status Flow:
```
Job Created ‚Üí collecting_bids ‚Üí (bids generated) ‚Üí active
                ‚Üì
            (user clicks "Stop Collecting")
                ‚Üì
              active
```

## üéØ **Demo Tips**

### For Maximum Impact:
1. **Create Multiple Jobs**: Show different trade categories
2. **Use Various Budget Ranges**: Demonstrate pricing adjustments
3. **Let Bids Appear Naturally**: Don't stop collection too quickly
4. **Explain the Real Process**: Mention that real contractors get emails

### Demo Script Suggestions:
- "When I post a job, it immediately starts collecting bids..."
- "You can see the loading animation - this simulates contractors receiving emails..."
- "Bids appear over time, just like in real life..."
- "I can stop collecting bids anytime, or let it run automatically..."

## üõ† **Troubleshooting**

### Demo Bids Not Appearing:
1. Check admin status: `is_admin = TRUE`
2. Check demo mode: `demo_mode = TRUE`
3. Verify job status: `status = 'collecting_bids'`
4. Check browser console for errors

### Status Not Updating:
1. Ensure timeout check is running (every 30 seconds)
2. Check `/api/check-bid-timeouts` endpoint
3. Verify database constraints are correct

### UI Issues:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify all migrations were run

## üìÅ **Files Modified**

### New Files:
- `supabase-migration-add-collecting-bids-status.sql`
- `app/api/check-bid-timeouts/route.ts`

### Updated Files:
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added collecting bids UI
- `app/dashboard/new-job/page.tsx` - Updated job creation flow
