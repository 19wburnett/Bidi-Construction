# 🔬 Hybrid AI Plan Analysis - Complete Implementation

## What We Built

A sophisticated **Hybrid Analysis System** that combines:
1. **GPT-4 Vision** - Sees and counts elements in plan drawings
2. **Text Extraction** - Reads specifications and dimensions  
3. **Cross-Referencing** - Verifies visual counts against text data

## 🎯 The Problem We Solved

**Original Question:** "Is it using images and looking at the images of the plans or just the text?"

**Answer:** NOW IT DOES BOTH! 

### Evolution:
1. **Text Only** → Could only read annotations, had to guess
2. **Vision Only** → Could see but might miss text specs
3. **Hybrid** → SEES drawings AND READS text, cross-references for accuracy ✅

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Step 1: Upload PDF
User uploads construction plan (any number of pages)

### Step 2: Dual Processing
```
PDF Buffer
    ├─→ PDF.co API → Convert ALL pages to PNG images
    └─→ pdf2json → Extract text with positions
```

### Step 3: Hybrid Analysis
```
OpenAI GPT-4o receives:
├─→ Extracted Text: "=== PAGE 1 === ... 200A panel ... (28) outlets ..."
└─→ Images: [page1.png, page2.png, page3.png, ...]

AI Analyzes Both:
├─→ VISION: "I see 28 outlet symbols (○) on pages 1-2"
├─→ TEXT: "Equipment schedule lists 28 outlets"  
└─→ CROSS-REFERENCE: "Both sources agree → High confidence!"
```

### Step 4: Results
```json
{
  "materials": [
    "(28) duplex outlets - counted visually on pages 1-2, verified in equipment schedule"
  ],
  "confidence": 92,
  "reasoning": "Visual and text data match"
}
```

## 📊 Accuracy Comparison

| Method | Electrical Outlets Example | Confidence |
|--------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Text Only** | "Outlets" (no count) | 50% |
| **Vision Only** | "(28) outlets counted" | 75% |
| **Hybrid** | "(28) outlets - counted visually, verified in schedule" | 92% |

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend: `/app/api/ai-plan-analysis/route.ts`

```typescript
// 1. Convert ALL pages to images
const imageUrls = await convertPDFToImages(buffer, fileName)
// Returns: ["https://pdf.co/image-page-1.png", "page-2.png", ...]

// 2. Extract text
const extractedText = await extractTextFromPDF(buffer)
// Returns: "=== PAGE 1 ===\nFloor Plan\nLiving Room 15' x 20'..."

// 3. Send both to GPT-4 Vision
await analyzeWithAI(imageUrls, extractedText, trade, fileName)
// Sends up to 10 images + 8000 chars text per analysis
```

### Trade-Specific Prompts

Each trade AI expert receives:
```
System: "You are a licensed electrician with 20+ years experience..."

Instructions:
1. VISUAL ANALYSIS: Count outlet symbols (○), switches (S), fixtures
2. TEXT ANALYSIS: Verify equipment schedule, specifications
3. CROSS-REFERENCE: Compare what you SEE with what's WRITTEN
4. Higher confidence when both match

User Message:
- Extracted Text: [8000 chars]
- Images: [up to 10 pages]
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "bidAmount": "$18,000 - $22,000",
  "materials": [
    "(28) duplex outlets - counted on pages 1-2, schedule confirms",
    "(12) GFCI outlets - bathroom/kitchen symbols match text callouts"
  ],
  "confidence": 92
}
```

## 💰 Cost Structure

### Per Analysis:
```
PDF.co:
- Upload: 1 API call

- Total: 6 calls = ~$0.02-0.03

OpenAI GPT-4o:
- Text tokens: ~2,000 input
- Image tokens: ~10,000 per image (5 images = 50,000)
- Output: ~1,500 tokens
- Total: ~$0.15-0.25 per trade

TOTAL per trade: ~$0.20-0.30
```
