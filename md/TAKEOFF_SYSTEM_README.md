## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration

Run the migration script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
# Copy contents of supabase-migration-takeoffs.sql
# Paste into Supabase SQL Editor and run
```

This creates:
- All required tables
- Indexes for performance
- Row Level Security policies
- Triggers for auto-updating timestamps
- Default cost templates

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 3. PDF Worker Setup

The PDF viewer requires a worker file. Ensure you have:

```
public/
  pdf.worker.min.js  # Downloaded from pdfjs-dist
```

Or set up the worker dynamically in the component.

### 4. Storage Bucket

Ensure your Supabase storage bucket allows:
- Public read access for plan files
- Authenticated write access for uploads

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Takeoff

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/takeoff/new`
2. Select a project with plan files
3. Choose a specific plan file
4. Name your takeoff
5. Toggle "Run AI Analysis" if desired
6. Click "Create Takeoff"

### Viewing a Takeoff

The takeoff page has three main areas:

1. **PDF Viewer (Left 2/3)**
   - View the plan with zoom, rotation controls
   - See AI-detected items highlighted as overlays
   - Click highlights to select items
   - Toggle overlays on/off

2. **Sidebar (Right 1/3)**
   - **Items Tab**: 
     - View all detected/manual items
     - Edit quantities, costs, descriptions
     - Add new items manually
     - Delete items
     - Search and filter
   - **Chat Tab**:
     - Ask AI questions
     - Get cost breakdowns
     - Identify missing materials

3. **Header**
   - Save versions
   - Run/re-run AI analysis
   - Share with team
   - Archive takeoff

### Using the AI Chat

Example questions:
- "How many square feet of drywall are on this floor plan?"
- "What's the total cost for electrical work?"
- "Am I missing any common materials for a kitchen renovation?"
- "What's the breakdown by category?"
- "How many outlets are in the living room?"

### Collaboration

- Multiple users can view and edit the same takeoff simultaneously
- Live presence indicators show who's viewing
- Changes auto-save and sync in real-time
- Comments can be added to specific items (future enhancement)

### Version Control

1. Click "Save Version" in the header
2. Enter a version name
3. The system creates a snapshot of:
   - Current takeoff data
   - All items and their values
   - Metadata

To restore a version (future feature):
1. View version history
2. Select a previous version
3. Click "Restore"

## AI Analysis Details

### How It Works

1. **Plan Upload**: User uploads a plan PDF/image to Supabase Storage
2. **Trigger Analysis**: User creates takeoff with "Auto Analyze" enabled
3. **Vision API Call**: System sends plan to OpenAI GPT-4 Vision
4. **Structured Extraction**: AI returns JSON array of detected items
5. **Data Validation**: System validates and normalizes the response
6. **Database Insert**: Items are inserted into `takeoff_items`
7. **User Review**: User can review, edit, or delete AI-detected items

### AI Prompt Engineering

The system uses a detailed system prompt that:
- Specifies exactly what to look for (7 categories of items)
- Defines the required output structure
- Requests confidence scores
- Asks for location references
- Emphasizes accuracy and completeness

### Confidence Scoring

Each AI-detected item includes a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0):
- **0.9-1.0**: Very confident
- **0.7-0.9**: Confident
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate confidence (review recommended)
- **0.0-0.5**: Low confidence (likely needs correction)

Users can see which items are AI-detected with the "AI" badge.

## Cost Templates

The system includes pre-populated cost templates for common trades:

- **Framing**: Wall framing, ceiling joists, floor joists
- **Electrical**: Outlets, switches, fixtures, panels
- **Drywall**: Installation, finishing, texture
- **Concrete**: Slabs, footings, walls
- **Plumbing**: Water/drain lines, toilet/sink installation

### Using Templates

1. Navigate to the sidebar
2. Add a new item manually
3. Select a category (e.g., "Electrical")
4. The system suggests common items with preset costs
5. Adjust quantities and costs as needed

## Real-Time Collaboration

### How It Works

- Uses Supabase Real-time subscriptions
- Listens for changes on `takeoff_items` and `takeoffs` tables
- Updates UI automatically when others make changes
- Presence tracking via `takeoff_presence` table

### Presence Indicators

- Shows avatar initials of active users
- Displays "N users viewing" in the PDF viewer
- Updates every 10 seconds
- Users are considered "active" if seen in last 30 seconds

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Lazy Loading**: Items load on demand
2. **Pagination**: Large takeoffs paginate item lists
3. **Debounced Search**: Search input is debounced
4. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates before server confirms
5. **Real-time Throttling**: Presence updates limited to 10s intervals

### Scaling

- API routes are serverless (Vercel-compatible) [[memory:7420523]]
- Database queries use indexes
- Real-time channels scoped to specific takeoffs
- AI analysis runs asynchronously

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Export Options**
   - Export to Excel with formatting
   - Generate PDF reports
   - Integration with accounting software

2. **Advanced Collaboration**
   - @mentions in comments
   - Task assignments
   - Approval workflows

3. **Enhanced AI**
   - Multi-page plan analysis
   - Dimension extraction from plans
   - Material supplier integration

4. **Mobile App**
   - Field takeoff capture
   - Voice-to-text item entry
   - Camera-based plan upload

5. **Version Comparison**
   - Visual diff between versions
   - Track who changed what
   - Audit trail

## Troubleshooting

### AI Analysis Fails

**Issue**: Analysis status shows "failed"

**Solutions**:
1. Check OpenAI API key is valid
2. Verify plan file URL is accessible
3. Check plan file format (PDF, JPG, PNG)
4. Review API error logs in Vercel/console
5. Ensure plan file is under 20MB

### Items Not Showing Overlays

**Issue**: AI-detected items don't show on PDF

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure `detection_coordinates` field has data
2. Check if overlays are toggled on (eye icon)
3. Verify coordinates are normalized (0-1 range)
4. Ensure `plan_page_number` matches current page

### Real-Time Updates Not Working

**Issue**: Changes from other users not appearing

**Solutions**:
1. Check Supabase real-time is enabled
2. Verify RLS policies allow SELECT access
3. Check browser console for connection errors
4. Ensure subscription channel is active
5. Try refreshing the page

### Chat Assistant Not Responding

**Issue**: AI chat returns errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify OpenAI API key and quota
2. Check takeoff has items to reference
3. Ensure chat history isn't too long (20 msg limit)
4. Review API error logs
