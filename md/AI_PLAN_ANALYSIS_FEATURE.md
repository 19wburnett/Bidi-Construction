# AI Plan Analysis Feature

## Overview
The AI Plan Analysis feature allows users to upload construction plans (PDF) and receive detailed, professional analysis from specialized AI contractors for each trade category. This uses OpenAI GPT-4 with trade-specific expert prompts to provide realistic bid estimates, material requirements, labor needs, and professional recommendations.

## How It Works

### 1. PDF Upload
- Users upload a PDF construction plan
- The system extracts **enhanced text** content from the PDF using `pdf2json`
- Text extraction includes:
  - Written specifications and notes
  - Dimensions and measurements from drawings
  - Material callouts and equipment schedules
  - Room labels and spatial information
  - Text is spatially sorted (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) for better context
- Text is validated to ensure it's readable (minimum 50 characters)

### 2. Trade Selection
Users can select from 8 specialized trade categories:
- **Electrical** ‚ö°
- **Plumbing** üîß
- **Framing** üèóÔ∏è
- **Concrete** üß±
- **Drywall** üî®
- **Roofing** üè†
- **HVAC** ‚ùÑÔ∏è
- **Flooring** üìê

### 3. AI Analysis
For each selected trade, a specialized AI "contractor" analyzes the plans:

#### Trade-Specific Expert Prompts

Each trade has a custom system prompt that instructs GPT-4 to act as a professional in that field:

**Electrical Example:**
```
You are a licensed master electrician with 20+ years of experience reviewing construction plans.
Analyze this construction plan focusing on:
- Electrical load calculations and panel requirements
- Code compliance (NEC standards)
- Wire sizing and circuit distribution
- Outlet and switch placement
- Lighting requirements
- GFCI/AFCI protection needs
- Potential safety hazards or code violations
- Service upgrade requirements
- Emergency/exit lighting needs
- Smart home pre-wiring opportunities
```

**Plumbing Example:**
```
You are a master plumber with extensive commercial and residential experience reviewing construction plans.
Analyze this construction plan focusing on:
- Water supply line sizing and routing
- Drain, waste, and vent (DWV) system requirements
- Fixture count and locations
- Water heater sizing and type recommendations
- Backflow prevention requirements
- Gas line requirements if applicable
- Potential drainage issues
- Access considerations for repairs
- Code compliance (IPC/UPC standards)
- Water conservation opportunities
```

All 8 trade categories have similarly detailed, professional-level prompts.

### 4. Structured Output

The AI returns a structured JSON response with:

```typescript
{
  trade: string                    // Trade name (e.g., "Electrical")
  bidAmount: string                // Cost range (e.g., "$15,000 - $20,000")
  estimatedTimeline: string        // Timeline (e.g., "10-14 business days")
  materials: string[]              // List of required materials
  labor: string                    // Labor team description
  potentialIssues: string[]        // Identified concerns or problems
  recommendations: string[]        // Professional recommendations
  confidence: number               // Confidence score 0-100
}
```

## Error Handling

### Frontend
- Upload validation (PDF files only)
- Error messages for failed analysis
- Graceful fallback to previous step on error
- User-friendly error alerts

### Backend
- PDF text extraction error handling
- OpenAI API error handling
- Invalid file type detection
- Empty/unreadable PDF detection
- Structured error responses

## Performance Considerations

- **PDF Processing**: Text extraction is fast (<1 second for most PDFs)
- **AI Analysis**: Takes 30-60 seconds depending on:
  - Number of selected trades
  - PDF complexity and length
  - OpenAI API response time
- **Parallel Processing**: All trades analyzed simultaneously for efficiency

## Security

- Admin-only access (requires `is_admin` flag in database)
- File validation before processing
- No permanent storage of uploaded PDFs
- OpenAI API key stored securely in environment variables

## Visual Elements & Text-Based Plans

### Current Approach
The system extracts text from PDFs, which includes:
- **Text annotations** on drawings (dimensions, callouts, notes)
- **Equipment schedules** and material specifications
- **Room labels** and area calculations
- **Legend descriptions** and symbol explanations

Most construction plans include extensive text that describes visual elements, making this approach effective for generating realistic bids.

### Limitations
- **Image-only PDFs**: Scanned plans without text layers won't work well
- **Pure diagrams**: Plans relying solely on visual symbols without text annotations may have reduced accuracy
- **Hand-drawn plans**: Sketches without digital text won't be analyzable

### For Best Results
Upload plans that include:
‚úÖ Dimension callouts and measurements
‚úÖ Material specifications in text
‚úÖ Equipment schedules
‚úÖ Notes and legends
‚úÖ Room labels and areas

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Full Vision Analysis**: Convert PDF pages to images and use GPT-4 Vision API
   - Analyze pure diagrams, symbols, and visual layouts
   - OCR for scanned/image-only PDFs
   - Requires canvas/image processing in Node.js environment
2. **Plan Storage**: Save analyses to database for future reference
3. **Bid Comparison**: Compare AI estimates with actual contractor bids
4. **Export Reports**: Generate PDF reports of analyses
5. **Batch Processing**: Upload and analyze multiple plans at once
6. **Cost Database Integration**: Pull real-time material costs
7. **Regional Adjustments**: Adjust estimates based on location/zip code
8. **Historical Learning**: Learn from past projects to improve accuracy
9. **Interactive Markup**: Allow users to highlight specific areas for detailed analysis
10. **3D Model Integration**: Analyze BIM models or 3D plan files
