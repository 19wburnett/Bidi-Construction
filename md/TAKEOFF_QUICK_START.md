```bash
# Verify your .env.local has OPENAI_API_KEY
# Get a new key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```

### "No items detected"

**Cause**: Plan quality or format issue

**Fix**:
- Use high-resolution plans (300+ DPI)
- Ensure text is readable
- Try with a different plan
- Add items manually

### "Real-time not working"

**Cause**: Supabase real-time not enabled

**Fix**:
1. Check `public/pdf.worker.min.js` exists
2. Or set in component:
   ```typescript
   pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = 
     `//unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@${pdfjs.version}/build/pdf.worker.min.js`
