# GC Contacts Import Feature

This feature allows General Contractors (GCs) to import and manage their own contractor contacts, enabling them to send job requests to their personal network.

## Features

### 1. Contact Import
- **File Formats**: Supports CSV and Excel (.xlsx, .xls) files
- **Bulk Import**: Import up to 1000 contacts at once
- **Template Download**: Download a CSV template with the correct format
- **Validation**: Automatic validation of email formats and required fields
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting for failed imports

### 2. Contact Management
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete contacts
- **Search & Filter**: Search by name, email, or company; filter by trade category and location
- **Contact Details**: Store name, email, company, phone, trade category, location, and notes

### 3. Database Schema
- **Table**: `gc_contacts`
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) ensures GCs can only access their own contacts
- **Unique Constraint**: Each GC can have unique email addresses (same contact can exist for different GCs)
